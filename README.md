# Commodity-Rental-Solution-

A prototype of a “Commodity Rental Solution” needs to be developed. On this product, users can sign up as lenders or renters. A lender can list a commodity (eg. a blazer, shoes, laptop) for rent and quote a minimum monthly charge for renting the commodity. A renter can put a bid for the available commodities on the product. Lender can accept a renter’s bid as per his liking and the commodity will get assigned to that user for the specified period mentioned from the renter’s end.
